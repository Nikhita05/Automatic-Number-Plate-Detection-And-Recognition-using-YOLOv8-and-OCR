Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition

This project implements **Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition (ANPR)** using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for reading license plate text.

📌 Features
- Detects vehicle number plates from images and video frames.
- Extracts plate region using YOLOv8.
- Recognizes text using OCR (Tesseract / EasyOCR).
- Can be extended for real-time recognition via a camera feed.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- OCR (EasyOCR / Tesseract)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
